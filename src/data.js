It was their closest conjunction since 2000, captured here above the eastern horizon before sunrise. The serene and colorful view is from Istia beach near the city of Capoliveri on the island of Elba. Distant lights and rolling hills are along Italy's Tuscan coast. Of course, the celestial pair soon wandered apart. Brighter Venus headed lower, toward the eastern horizon and the glare of the Sun, while Jupiter continues to rise a little higher now in the sky near dawn. The two brightest planets meet again next June 30th, in the evening twilight above the western horizon.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1408/VenusJupiterIsoladElba_DeRosa.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Venus and Jupiter at Dawn","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1408/VenusJupiterIsoladElba_DeRosa1024.jpg"},{"copyright":"Alex Conu","date":"2016-06-16","explanation":"The Aurora Borealis or northern lights are familiar visitors to night skies above the village of Reine in the Lofoten Islands, Norway, planet Earth.

Prominent at the upper right is NGC 7331. A mere 50 million light-years away, the large spiral is one of the brighter galaxies not included in Charles Messier's famous 18th century catalog. The disturbed looking group of galaxies at the lower left is well-known as Stephan's Quintet. About 300 million light-years distant, the quintet dramatically illustrates a multiple galaxy collision, its powerful, ongoing interactions posed for a brief cosmic snapshot. On the sky, the quintet and NGC 7331 are separated by about half a degree.   digg_url ='http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap090806.html'; digg_skin = 'compact';","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0908/NGC7331-hager.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Galaxies in Pegasus","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0908/NGC7331-hager800.jpg"},{"date":"2015-10-11","explanation":"Clouds of glowing gas mingle with dust lanes in the Trifid Nebula, a star forming region toward the constellation of the Archer (Sagittarius).  In the center, the three prominent dust lanes that give the Trifid its name all come together. Mountains of opaque dust appear on the right, while other dark filaments of dust are visible threaded throughout the nebula.  A single massive star visible near the center causes much of the Trifid's glow.  The Trifid, also known as M20, is only about 300,000 years old, making it among the youngest emission nebulae known.  The nebula lies about 9,000 light years away and the part pictured here spans about 10 light years.

Perhaps it is a key marker for the beginning of a new magnetic cycle on our Sun.  Every 11 years, our Sun goes through a magnetic cycle, at the end of which its overall magnetic orientation is reversed.   An 11-year solar cycle has been observed for hundreds of years by noting peaks and valleys in the average number of sunspots. Just now, the Sun is near Solar Minimum, and likely to start a long progression toward the most active time, called Solar Maximum, in about 5.5 years.  An indicator that the sun's magnetic field is reversing is the appearance of sunspots with the reverse magnetic polarity than normal.  A few weeks ago, one small candidate reverse sunspot was sighted but faded quickly.  Now, however, a larger sunspot with negative polarity is being tracked.  This sunspot, numbered 905, appears as the unusual white spot in the above magnetic image of the Sun taken with the SOHO spacecraft a few days ago.   In the past few days, Sunspot 905 has actually begun to break apart and might also become the source of coronal mass ejections and explosive solar flares. Solar astronomers predict that the coming Solar Maximum will be unusually active.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0608/reversesunspot_soho_big.gif","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"A Backward Sunspot and the New Solar Cycle","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0608/reversesunspot_soho.jpg"},{"date":"2009-12-21","explanation":"In the center of star-forming region 30 Doradus lies a huge cluster of the largest, hottest, most massive stars known. These stars, known collectively as star cluster R136, were captured above in visible light by the newly installed Wide Field Camera peering though the recently refurbished Hubble Space Telescope. Gas and dust clouds in 30 Doradus, also known as the Tarantula Nebula, have been sculpted into elongated shapes by powerful winds and ultraviolet radiation from these hot cluster stars.

In visible light, much of the Galactic Center is obscured by opaque dust.  In infrared light, however, dust glows more and obscures less, allowing nearly one million stars to be recorded in the above photograph.  The Galactic Center itself appears on the right and is located about 30,000 light years away towards the constellation of Sagittarius.  The Galactic Plane of our Milky Way Galaxy, the plane in which the Sun orbits, is identifiable by the dark diagonal dust lane.  The absorbing dust grains are created in the atmospheres of cool red-giant stars and grow in molecular clouds.  The region directly surrounding the Galactic Center glows brightly in radio and high-energy radiation, and is thought to house a large black hole.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/9906/gcenter_2mass_big.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"The Galactic Center in Infrared","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/9906/gcenter_2mass.jpg"},{"date":"1999-09-21","explanation":"Bright clusters of stars form and disperse near the center of our Galaxy.   Four million years ago the Quintuplet Cluster, pictured above, formed and is now slowly dispersing.  The Quintuplet Cluster is located within 100 light-years of the Galactic center, and is home to the brightest star yet cataloged in our Galaxy: the Pistol Star.  Objects near our Galactic center are usually hidden from view by opaque dust. This recently-released picture was able to capture the cluster in infrared light, though, with the NICMOS camera onboard the orbiting Hubble Space Telescope.  The young Quintuplet Cluster is one of the most massive open clusters yet discovered, but still much less massive than the ancient globular clusters that orbit in the distant halo.  Some of the bright white stars visible above may be on the verge of blowing themselves up in a spectacular supernova.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/9909/quintuplet_hst_big.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"The Quintuplet Star Cluster","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/9909/quintuplet_hst.jpg"},{"copyright":"E.

According to the Holographic Principle, the most information you can get from this image is about 3 x 1065 bits for a normal sized computer monitor.  The Holographic Principle, yet unproven, states that there is a maximum amount of information content held by regions adjacent to any surface.  Therefore, counter-intuitively, the information content inside a room depends not on the volume of the room but on the area of the bounding walls.  The principle derives from the idea that the Planck length, the length scale where quantum mechanics begins to dominate classical gravity, is one side of an area that can hold only about one bit of information.  The limit was first postulated by physicist Gerard 't Hooft in 1993.  It can arise from generalizations from seemingly distant speculation that the information held by a black hole is determined not by its enclosed volume but by the surface area of its event horizon.  The term \"holographic\" arises from a hologram analogy where three-dimension images are created by projecting light though a flat screen.  Beware, other people looking at the above image may not claim to see 3 x 1065 bits -- they might claim to see a teapot.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0712/teapotsirds_winfree_big.gif","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"The Holographic Principle","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0712/teapotsirds_winfree_big.jpg"}]
